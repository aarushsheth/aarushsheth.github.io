### the path integral

*This is intended to be the first in a series of posts 
where I go through a (mostly) first-principles walkthrough 
of how you can use the tools of quantum field theory to recover standard results on option pricing. 
This first post will motivate and develop the Feynman Path Integral 
formulation of quantum mechanics*.
