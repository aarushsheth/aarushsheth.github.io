### the path integral

*This is intended to be the first in a series of posts 
where I go through a (mostly) first-principles walkthrough 
of how you can use the tools of quantum field theory to recover standard results on option pricing. 
This first post will motivate and develop the Feynman Path Integral 
formulation of quantum mechanics*.


One of, if not the best known result in quantum mechanics 
is the classic double slit experiment. The setup is simple. 
Consider emitting a particle from a source, which then passes
through one of two holes drilled in a screen and is detected 
on the other side. After repeating this a number of times, classical intuition would suggest that 
particles would bunch around the two slits. Of course, 
we know that the particles act as waves 
and interfere which each other, creating the infamous striped pattern seen below.

We can compute the probability amplitude of this particle at any point  
by summing together the amplitude of the particle
passing through the first slit and the amplitude of the 
particle passing through the second slit. A natural 
question then.
