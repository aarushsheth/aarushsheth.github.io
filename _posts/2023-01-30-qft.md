### the path integral

*This is intended to be the first in a series of posts 
where I go through a (mostly) first-principles walkthrough 
of how you can use the tools of quantum field theory to recover standard results on option pricing. 
This first post will motivate and develop the Feynman Path Integral 
formulation of quantum mechanics*.


One of, if not the best known result in quantum mechanics 
is the classic double slit experiment. The setup is simple. 
Consider emitting a particle from a source, which then passes
through one of two holes drilled in a screen and is detected 
on the other side. After repeating this a number of times, classical intuition would suggest that 
particles would bunch around the two slits. Of course, 
we know that the particles act as waves 
and interfere which each other, creating the infamous striped pattern seen below.

We can compute the probability amplitude of this particle at any point  
by summing together the amplitude of the particle
passing through the first slit and the amplitude of the 
particle passing through the second slit. A natural 
question then, is what happens if we add a third slit, 
or add another screen with an additional slit? 
Clearly, we still sum the three amplitudes together. 
Of course, this generalizes if we have have four, or five, 
or $n$ total slits. Now, consider what happens if between 
the particle emitter and the detector, we place an infinite 
number of screens with an infinite number of slits. We can still 
calculate its amplitude by summing together the amplitudes 
of every possible path it could take.  However, note that 
with infinite screens with infinite slits, the 
screens effectively don't exist, and particle is moving 
through empty space, i.e, it can take any path!

In other words, 
*for a particle traveling from point $A$ to $B$, 
its probability amplitude is equal to the sum of the 
amplitudes of every possible path between $A$ and $B$.* This 
stunning fact underlies the path integral formulation 
of quantum mechanics, which we'll show is equivalent 
to the Schrodinger equation.

## finding a path

Consider a particle which travels 
from a point $q_I$ to $q_F$. Its time
evolution operator is $e^{-iHt}$, where 
$H$ denotes the Hamiltonian(recall, this is roughly, 
the sum of the particles energies).


Then, 
to find the particles amplitude, we have [^1]
to evaluate $\langle q_F | e^{-iHT} | q_I \rangle$ [^2].


[^1]: Test
[^2]: Recall that in bra-ket notation, we use \|$ v \rangle$ to denote a vector $v$ in a complex vector space and $\langle f $\| to denote a linear map $f: V \mapsto \mathbb{C}$. The value of $f$,at $v$ is the inner product of the two, denoted $\langle f$ \| $v \rangle$ . When 
we write $\langle q_F | e^{-iHT} | q_I \rangle$, we therefore are
applying the linear operator $e^{-iHT}$ to $| q_I \rangle$, 
getting a ket back, and taking the inner product 
of this with $\langle q_F |$.
